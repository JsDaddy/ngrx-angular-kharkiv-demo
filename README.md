This app for First Angular Meetup in Kharkiv.

This talk is about how to bring your Angular application to a new level of reactivity.

Using Redux architecture with RsJs help us to collect and react to the many different streams of information and provide a central source of truth for an application state at any given moment. 

It helps to cope with new challenges and hard requirements in the web world.
